# Review 5 - Functions

NOTE! Pay close attention to creating code with good and consistent code style.

1. Write a normal function that takes in two numbers and *returns* the sum of those numbers.
2. Write a normal function that takes in a string and *returns* that string capitalized.
3. Write a normal function that takes in an array and *returns* the last item in that array.
4. Write an arrow function that takes in an array and *returns* the first item in that array.
5. Write an arrow function that takes in a string and *returns* the last three characters of that string.
6. Write an arrow function that takes in an array and *returns* the type of the first item in that array.
7. Write an arrow function that takes in an array and *returns* true, if all items in that array have the same type.
8. Print the `type` of a variable that has a normal function value.
9. Print the `type` of a variable that has an arrow function value.
10. Write and test a function that takes in two parameters (min and max). That function should return another function that doesn't take in any parameters, but returns a random number between min and max. Effectively your "outer" function is a factory that creates customized random number generator functions.
11. In your own words, explain what are side effects and what is a pure function.
12. In your own words, explain what is the difference between functions and methods.
